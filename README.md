## Vision & Mood

**What is the campaign vision?** (e.g, 'This campaign captures the urgency of experiencing Disney magic through a child's believing eyes. Every image should evoke the bittersweet awareness that this window of pure belief is precious and temporary, motivating parents to act now while their daughter still sees real princesses, not performers')
